# Arkeus


I felt inspired to make another game (after playing a bunch of MUDs). So I browsed the scripts for the [previous text games](https://github.com/PixelXII/games/tree/master/text) and realized it wasn't the most organized or clean. So I created another one, and a bigger one this time, too. The items are all objects instead of strings, and all of ```game.js``` is objects.
